Regression Project
Applying supervised learning to solve regression problems.

In this repo we look at applying a variety of SupervisedLearning models to predict a variety of regression data-sets.

I used this dataset from Kaggle for car prices:
https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset
(save it in the root directory as "car_data.csv")

I used this dataset from Kaggle for test_scprse:
https://www.kaggle.com/kwadwoofosu/predict-test-scores-of-students
(save it in the root directory as "test_scores.csv")


Run the project by running:
```
$ python3 main.py
```


The following models were run on the dataset:
    - K-Nearest-Neighbours
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - SVR
